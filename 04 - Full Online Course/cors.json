Note: By default, a Cloud Storage bucket requires Firebase Authentication to perform any action on the bucket's data or files. You can change your Firebase Security Rules for Cloud Storage to allow unauthenticated access. Since Firebase and your project's default App Engine app share this bucket, configuring public access may make newly uploaded App Engine files publicly accessible, as well. Be sure to restrict access to your Cloud Storage bucket again when you set up Authentication.


CORS Configuration
To download data directly in the browser, you must configure your Cloud Storage bucket for cross-origin access (CORS). This can be done with the gsutil command line tool, which you can install from here.

If you don't want any domain-based restrictions (the most common scenario), copy this JSON to a file named cors.json:


[
  {
    "origin": ["*"],
    "method": ["GET"],
    "maxAgeSeconds": 3600
  }
]
Run gsutil cors set cors.json gs://<your-cloud-storage-bucket> to deploy these restrictions.

For more information, refer to the Google Cloud Storage documentation.
